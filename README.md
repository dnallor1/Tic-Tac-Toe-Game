# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
This repository contains a Python implementation of a Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game allows two players, "X" and "O", to take turns and automatically checks for a winner. It also includes an AI opponent that uses the Minimax algorithm to make optimal moves. The code is well-documented and structured for easy understanding.
